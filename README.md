# I2C_Device_Driver_For_Cortex-M_microcontroller
This project consist of Device Driver Development code for Configuring I2C Bus for serial comminication on Cortex-M microcontroller.
I have tried to write Driver code as generic as possible for Cortex-M based boards but, it was written specifically as per STM32F446re nucleo board hardware design, 
user can used this project/code by including it as libray in program but, first needs to modify the code as per the microcontroller board design user is dealing with.
Thankyou!!
